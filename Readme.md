    This is an unofficial mirror of the http://sourceware.org/git/binutils-gdb.git
    binutils-gdb repository. 
    In addition to frequent updates from the upstream source, it contains:

    1. Branches with patches and work-in-progress from Oracle developers not 
    yet integrated in the upstream codebase. These branches enable upstream 
    reviewers to view and test proposed patches and work-in-progress in 
    context of the entire source tree.

    2. Branches with completed work by Oracle developers already accepted 
    upstream. These branches offer a convenient way to view accepted 
    contributions by Oracle developers in full context.
    
    The code in this repository is to be considered a technology preview 
    and is not officially supported.
