This is an unofficial mirror of the http://sourceware.org/git/binutils-gdb.git binutils-gdb repository.
In addition to frequent updates from the upstream source, it contains:

1. Branches with patches and work-in-progress from Oracle developers not yet integrated in the upstream codebase. These branches enable upstream reviewers to view and test proposed patches and work-in-progress in context of the entire source tree.

2. Branches with completed work by Oracle developers already accepted upstream. These branches offer a convenient way to view accepted contributions by Oracle developers in full context.

The code in this repository is to be considered a technology preview and is not officially supported.

This file (Readme.md) resides in its own branch due to technical requirements of the GitHub software. The contents of this Readme.md apply to the all code in this repository which resides in other branches.
