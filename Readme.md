In addition to frequent updates from the upstream source, it contains:

1. Branches with patches and work-in-progress from Oracle developers not yet integrated in the upstream codebase. These branches enable upstream reviewers to view and test proposed patches and work-in-progress in context of the entire source tree.

2. Branches with completed work by Oracle developers already accepted upstream. These branches offer a convenient way to view accepted contributions by Oracle developers in full context.

The code in this repository is to be considered a technology preview and is not officially supported.
